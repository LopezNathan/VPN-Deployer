# VPN Deployer

## Simple OpenVPN Deploy CLI Tool

This CLI tool will install OpenVPN utilizing the [OpenVPN Installer by Angristan](https://github.com/Angristan/OpenVPN-install) on a DigitalOcean Droplet.
Once OpenVPN has been installed, NGINX is installed and a link is provided to download the OpenVPN Client file.

**This is only intended for short-term/one-time use, as currently no major security protection is added to the base server.**

## Installation

This package requires Python 3.7

```bash
$ pip3 install git+https://github.com/LopezNathan/vpn-deployer
```

You will now have access to the `vpndeployer` command.

## Usage

```bash
$ vpndeployer --help

usage: vpndeployer [-h] [--ip IP] [--email EMAIL] [--name NAME]
                   [--region REGION]
                   [--image {centos-7-x64}]

### Example

> vpndeployer

- You will be prompted for your [DigitalOcean API Token](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/api/create-personal-access-token/). This is only passed through `getpass` to the DigitalOcean API during the creation of the droplet and obtaining the droplet IP.

Once the installer has completed, it will output the OpenVPN download link. This link automatically expires in 5 minutes.
