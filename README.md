# VPN Deployer
### Simple OpenVPN Deploy Script to DigitalOcean Cloud

This script will install OpenVPN utilizing the [OpenVPN Installer by Angristan](https://github.com/Angristan/OpenVPN-install).
Once OpenVPN has been installed, NGINX & Sendmail are installed and an email is sent with a link to download the .ovpn client file (most likely in spam folder). This link will only be available for 5 minutes before NGINX is removed.

**This is only intended for short-term/one-time use, as currently no extra security is added to the base server.**
